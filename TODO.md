# API Enhancements

* Extend the poller configuration -> provide a definition for our node in a new package?
** Poller should be able to add service monitors/entries to packages during a reload, and have these monitored
** on existing nodes

# General

* Add support for multiple controllers, or clusters of controllers
* Add support for controller clusters (round-robin rest requests?)
* Structure things in a way to allow for multiple controllers to be running different versions
* Remove assumptions from support augmentations
